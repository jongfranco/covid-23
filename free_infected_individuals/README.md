# Explanatory Notes
  - The file epi_fii.rb estimates the number of Free Infected Individuals.  Its inputs are
    - cases (daily cumulative case count)
    - deaths (daily cumulative deaths)
    - prevalence (calculated using epi_prevalance.rb file)
  - The file epi_prevalence.rb file estimates the number of currently infected individuals. It has as input
    - incidence (daily new cases)
  - The file epi_cdr.rb estimates the Case Detection Ratio. Its inputs are
    - cases (daily cumulative deaths)
  - deaths  (daily cumulative deaths)
    - max_delay (maximum lag used by LogNormalConvolve)
    - ccfr (The CFR or IFR with CI)
  - The file log_normal_convolve.rb does a convolution of a vector with a lognormal density function. Its inputs are
    - mean of lognormal distribution (only used if z_mean is not present)
    - std of lognormal distribution (only used if z_mean is not present)
    - z_mean of lognormal distribution
    - z_median of lognormal distribution
    - max_delay (maximum lag used by convolution)
